⚙️ Welcome to the HyperTech Workshop! 🔨

This is a repo template that explores new technology workflows. It is comprised of different trending aggregated learning resources and interactive examples that help illustrate and entertain some of the exciting possibilities of new breakthroughs in machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processors. Some topics covered here are (but not limited to): researching and developing large language and/or diffusion models, building and deploying inference APIs, fine-tuning and aligning models (+ more!). 

This digital workshop is a file structure template that will be casually maintained as it mirrors personal workflows and processes. Please do not confuse this with a product. It is simply personal workflows and projects I do for fun. Throughout this repo, you may or may not stumble across HyperTech. Curiosity is advised. You are encouraged to decorate this developer space / digital environment with your own files, projects, functions, assets, and experiments. Anything that helps you build your project! Consider files you create in your hypertech space as posters in your workshop. A decoration of innovation. Inspiration for our journeys into the great unknown!

Fork or archive your local repo when a workshop gets messy. Duplicate, edit, rename, tear-down or build-up as many workshops as you need! Keep or delete my files or folders. It's totally up to you. The moment you clone or fork this repo - consider this digital workshop yours to build and design as you see fit. Share your forks and workflow templates with others! 
    
`Note`: This field is rapdily evolving, this particular `HyperTech` `Template` may shift and change over the course of the near (and distant) future.

### `/arcade`

*(coming soon!)*

### `/articy`

Folder for articy tools and projects. This is for quickly prototyping narratives with a node-based workflow that can be exported into [various data formats](https://www.articy.com/help/Export%20and%20Import_TOC.html).

### `/containers`

Folder for composable docker scripts and images. This is for prototyping projects with pods or containers that help you build other stuff in your workshop.

### `/data`

Folder for local data you want to import, export, explore, or analyze. This is for databases, assets, and other objects that supplement your project and workshop.

### `/docs`

An aggregated (and growing) handbook of resources you can tinker with to learn more about large language models and their fascinating concepts and workflows. These are various `.ipynb` & `jupyter` style notebooks I collect and learn from experiments and prototypes showcased by many amazing content creators below. Give those channels a visit, each and every one of them provide insight. There are many people to learn from, I've found each as great as the last.

### `/lib`

Folder for local libraries. Utilize this directory as a dynamic folder for different application requirements (or as a literal library!).

### `/logs`

Folder to direct output logs and other notes from automated or manual services built from your workshop.

### `/notebooks`

Personal notebooks I use to explore new projects and possibilities. These workflows are random opportunities I try to create to apply my learnings. You are welcome to copy/paste any of the workflows you see into versions of your own. Hack away! Build your own! Share with others! Use this folder as a digital journal that interweaves projects and notes.

### `/scripts`

Folder for random one-off scripts or tools that help you kit or customize your workshop.

### `/source`

Folder that contains anything required to build your own custom image, container, or automated redeployment of your digital workshop.

### `/tests`

Folder for custom workshop tests and evaluations. Use this folder for finalized scripts that validate the integrity of your workshop.
