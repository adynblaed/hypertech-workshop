# Welcome to Your New Hypertech Workshop!

Start decorating this digital workshop with your files, functions, assets, images, and anything else you might need to develop your project!

Try not to add or remove a folder. You can add as many files to each folder structure as you'd like. 

All you need to do to get started is remove the '.txt' at the end of the '.gitignore'.
